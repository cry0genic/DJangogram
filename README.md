# DJangogram
## Basic Idea
You will be building a mini social media site with a few basic features. There will be some essential features you are supposed to implement. Apart from these, feel free to show off your creativity as a developer. There is also no need for your app to “look” good. (Leave that to the frontend devs).

## Mandatory Features
- User authentication. Users must be able to register/login to your app. We expect you to use Django’s built-in auth system.
- Each user must have a profile in which they can add/update data. This data can be: Name, Bio, Profile Pic, etc.
- User’s should be able to make posts and make comments on posts. No need to implement comment replies for now.
- Allow users to follow each other. Think about how you’ll implement this using Django’s models.
- Make it possible to edit and delete posts. Think about the implications of this. How would you prevent cyber-bullying/cyber-crime caused by this feature?
- Let the user see a feed on the homepage. This feed should include posts by people the user follows.
